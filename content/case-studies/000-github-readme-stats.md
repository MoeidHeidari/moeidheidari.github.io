title: Github Readme Stats
excerpt:
  Github Readme Stats dynamically generates stats for github user's readmes,
  After github launched it's profile readme feature I thought I would do
  something unique and dynamic with new readme resumes so I made
  github-readme-stats which is now used by many people and got over 1k stars on
  github within 7 days, and currently it has over 30k stars. it has few cool
  features including `Github Extra Pins` which allows us to pin more that 6
  repos in our profile.

info:
  idea:
    The main idea of github-readme-stats is to serve github user's stats
    dynamically with the help of github api and rendered with svgs.
  tech: [Github API, Vercel, Serverless]

Hey guys! i hope you are doing well.

Yesterday after seeing that lot of people on twitter are creating their Github
profile Readmes i thought i should do something cool & unique, so i created this
->

### Github Readme Stats

[![Github Readme Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=anuraghazra&repo=github-readme-stats)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

Github readme stats allows you to simply add a markdown image link and it will
show you realtime stats for your github account.

```md
![Anurag's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra)
```

And the cool thing is since it's just an image you can embed it anywhere even on
any websites!

Live Demo:

Pretty neat isn't it? Try it out right now on your profile readme too! :D

After seeing that people liked the `Github Stats Card` idea i created
`Github Extra Pins`

### Github Extra Pins

Github extra pins allows you to pin more than 6 repositories in your profile by
using github readme profile.

**Yey! you are no longer limited to 6 pinned repos**
